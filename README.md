# CrazyBytes!

### Yet another card game suite, written in Java.

Why? Well... It was my 1st semester project for uni and I decided to go kinda over the top with it. It was supposed to be a simple implementation of crazy eights, but quickly I wanted more, so I added modifiers, other gamemodes, AI, online module etc. and... here we are.

The project is still slowly maintained in my free time. I sort of use it as my learning/practice ground, but with the ultimate goal to make it stable, ready to play and full of different card games to choose from.

### List of implemented games:
- [x] Crazy Eights
- [x] Blackjack
- [ ] Hearts
- [ ] Poker

### What works:
- [x] Local with bots
- [x] Local multiplayer
- [ ] LAN multiplayer (soon)
- [ ] Online multiplayer

## Development

### Build/run

**Prerequisite:** Java 17+

Simply use the included Gradle wrapper - `./gradlew <cmd>` (or `gradlew.bat <cmd>` on Windows) from the root folder of the project to run the game. `<cmd>` - `run` for quick run, `build` for jar build.
